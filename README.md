A raw project to use databases in general
So as mentionned just before, i wanted to use this project as a setp-up to upgrade myself in my database's uses. So far i've used Microsoft Visual Studio with the extension SQL Server to maintain a database and for the future features : create tables and make it usable. I've also used MySQL Workbench, Dbeaver and PHPmyAdmin in the process to understand their functionning and to develop my knowledge on them, and to be more precise : i find Microsoft Visual Studio more visually entertaining with mutliple functions to execute more precisely some actions yet really complicated because you have to use several things in the same time to make it useful at all.

I haven't finish it yet but i wanted to make something easy and not really mind-blowing at the first sight, so i made a little draw of what i wanted to see in the database, at least the representation of it in my mind. Each tables possess differents attributes and those attributes are all converging at the end to the end to the table Employees, hence his representation ressembling very much to two children holding hands from their parents.
I didn't wanted something much of it, but the main goal was to make something clear and not hurtful to those who wanted to implemented it, the main base of it should serve as a starting point for the future implementations and an idea of what order you should follow, but it's still uncomplete so i want to finish it in the time !
